In 1882 he discovered that bacteria could be killed by heat, and in 1884 he demonstrated that this process could be used to kill bacteria in food. In 1889 he developed the first method of sterilizing food with heat, which he called ""pasteurization"". Pasteur's discovery of the bacterium Bacillus anthracis (B. anthracinus) led to a new era of sanitation, and he became one of the most influential scientists of the 20th century.
In 1887, Pasteur published his book Le Monde de la Santé, which was translated into English as The World of Health. It was the first scientific book to be written in French.
The Pasteur Institute was founded in Paris in 1891. It is now located in the city center.

Plato (/ˈpleɪtoʊ/ PLAY-toe;[1] Greek: Πλάτων Plátōn; 428/427 or 424/423 – 348 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher born in Athens during the Classical period. He is considered one of the greatest philosophers of all time, and his works are widely regarded as the foundation of Western philosophy. His work has been translated into more than 100 languages.

Platonic philosophy is a branch of philosophy that developed from the work of Plato. It is characterized by its emphasis on the relationship between mind and body, and the importance of the senses. The term ""Plato"" comes from the Greek word platonos (plural platos), which means ""mind"".

The name ""Platonism"" is derived from the word platoin (platoin = mind), which is the Greek root for the English word ""philosophy"", meaning ""thinking"".
In the early centuries after Plato's death, the term ""philology"" was used to refer to the study of philosophy. However, this term was not used until the 19th century.
The term ""Philosophy"" was first used in the 18th century by the French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, who called it ""the science of the soul"".
The word ""Platypus"" is also derived from Plato's name.
Platonists believe that the soul is the source of all knowledge, and that the mind is the seat of all thought. They believe that there is no such thing as a physical body, but rather a spiritual body that exists outside of the physical world.

Mary Magdalene[a] (sometimes called Mary of Magdala, or simply the Magdalene, Magdalena or the Madeleine) was a woman who, according to the four canonical gospels, traveled with Jesus as one of his followers and was a witness to his crucifixion and resurrection. She is also known as the ""Woman at the Well"" in John's Gospel.[1][2]

The Gospel of Mark records that she was present when Jesus was crucified on the cross, but she did not see him die. The Gospel of Luke reports that she saw him rise from the dead, but did not know that he had been crucified. The Gospels of Matthew and John report that she witnessed the burial of Jesus, but that she did no more than tell her friends what had happened. The Acts of the Apostles reports that Mary Magdelene was present at the burial, but does not mention her having seen Jesus rise from death.

In the New Testament, Mary Magdaline is often referred to by the name of the disciple who accompanied Jesus during his ministry. In the Gospel of John, she is identified as the disciple whom Jesus loved most, and who was present for his crucifixions and resurrection.[3] In the Gospels, she appears as a companion of Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane, where he prayed before his arrest and crucifixion. In Matthew, she accompanies him to the tomb after his arrest, and in Luke, she follows him to Jerusalem after his crucifixation. In Mark, she joins him in the garden after his resurrection, and is present at his ascension into heaven. In Luke, Mary is present with Jesus in Galilee after his ascensions, and at his last supper.

He is considered one of the most influential figures in the history of psychology.[4][5]
Freud's work has been described as ""the most important contribution to the study of human behavior since the Enlightenment"".[6] His theories have influenced many fields of psychology, including psychiatry, anthropology, sociology, and philosophy.
The term ""Freudian"" is used to refer to his theories, but he himself never used the term. The term ""psychoanalytic"" is also used to describe his theories.
Freuds' theories were based on the idea that the unconscious mind is the source of all psychological problems. He believed that the mind is a complex system of thoughts, feelings, and memories that are not fully understood by the conscious mind. This view is known as the ""Freudsian"" view of the mind.
In his book The Interpretation of Dreams (1932), Freud argued that dreams are a form of communication between the subconscious and the conscious. In his book On the Origin of Dreams, published in 1934, Freud argued for the existence of a ""dream-world"", which he called the ""subconscious"".

John Ronald Reuel Tolkien CBE FRSL (/ˈruːl ˈtɒlkiːn/, ROOL TOL-keen;[a] 3 January 1892 – 2 September 1973) was an English writer and philologist. He is best known for his works The Lord of the Rings (1954–59), The Hobbit (1958–60), The Silmarillion (1963–66), and The History of Middle-earth (1967). His work has been translated into more than fifty languages, and he is one of the most widely read authors in history.
Tolkien's early life was marked by poverty and hardship. He was born in a small village near the Welsh border to a poor family. His father, a farmer, died when he was young, leaving his mother to raise him and his younger brother. She worked as a domestic servant, and her earnings were insufficient to support them both. In 1913, she married a wealthy landowner, who provided her with a home and a steady income.
In 1920, Tolkien graduated from the University of Oxford, where he studied classics and philosophy. He then moved to London, where his first job was as a clerk at the British Museum. He later became a lecturer at the University College London, and in 1929 he was appointed professor of English literature at the university.
He published his first book, The Adventures of Tom Bombadil, in 1931. It was a popular children's story about a boy who travels through the world on a quest to find his lost dog. The book sold well, and it was followed by The Hobbit in 1937.

10. Tolkien's first job after graduating from the University of Oxford was not at the British Museum. He worked initially on the New English Dictionary and later as an assistant on the Oxford English Dictionary.
