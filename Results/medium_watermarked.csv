He is also regarded as a pioneer in human geography.[3][4] The most famous of these expeditions, which began with his arrival in 1492 in what is now the state of Ohio, led to the discovery of the New World by Europeans.[5] The voyage also established the first permanent settlements in what would become the United States, which became the first country outside of Europe to establish a colony. The voyage led to several discoveries about the continent that were subsequently used to establish trade routes and the development of the modern world.
Columbus' voyage led directly to the formation of the first transcontinental railroad,[6] and the discovery and naming of the South Pole (which he named after his wife Isabella).[7][8] The voyages also brought the first written records of the languages and cultures of the native peoples that Columbus encountered.[9] The Columbus expedition has been described as a ""pioneer in human history""[10] and a ""master of the seas"" and a great sailor.[11] The events of the voyage have inspired numerous works of fiction and non-fiction.[12][13][14]

He is also known as Pope John XXIII, Pope John XII or Pope John XI, because he served as a papal candidate for John XII in 1958.[2][3] The title ""Pontiff"" is used to refer only to him. The Latin phrase ""Pontifex Maximus"" (""Pontifical High Priest"") refers only to the pope's office, which is held by him alone, and not to any other pontificates. The title of ""Pontificals"" is also sometimes used to describe all of the papal encyclicals issued by the pope since the beginning of the 20th century. The term ""pontifical"", however, does not mean any particular office, but rather the whole body of papal documents, which are published under the papacy's name, and thus are not considered separate.

She was awarded the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize for her activism on climate change. She is also the youngest recipient of the 2019 Albert Einstein Award for Environmental Achievement. She attended the Swedish National School of Economics in Stockholm, where she studied economics and mathematics before moving to New York City for college studies in 2015. She now lives in Los Angeles, California.
Thunberg started her activism after being inspired by Swedish teenager Greta Steenholm's protests against global warming, which began in August 2018. She joined the Fridays for Future movement in August 2019, which grew out of the #FridaysForFuture campaign initiated by Steenholm, which had been in place since September 2018. The movement has grown rapidly since then, with more than one million young people taking part worldwide in over 1,500 demonstrations, marches, strikes, and school strikes. The number of demonstrations increased dramatically following the 2019 UN Climate Change Conference (COP25), when Thunburg became the youngest speaker ever at an international conference.

Pablo Ruiz Picasso[a][b] (25 October 1881 – 8 April 1973) was a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist, and theatre designer who spent most of his adult life in France. He is known for his abstract expressionist paintings, which have been described as ""the best-known artistic movement in the history of Western art"" and for his use of the cubist style in his works of figurative painting. He received the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1964.[2]
Picasso's early works were influenced by Cubism, which he saw as a ""natural progression"" from his earlier impressionist paintings. However, he rejected it in favour of the more expressive, figurative style, which became his trademark during the 1950s and 1960s. He also produced some of the first examples of the so-called ""post-impressionist"" style, where the subject matter was not explicitly related to the subject of the work. The most famous example of this style are his self-portraits, which show him in various poses. He often painted portraits in his spare time, often with women or children as subjects. He made many of these in his home in Paris, where he lived until his death. He worked on numerous projects throughout his lifetime, including several sculptures, drawings, books, posters, murals and installations.[3]

He was one of the first philosophers to write extensively about metaphysics.[2][3] The most famous of these is the Republic, which contains several of Plato’s major dialogues with Socrates. The Republic is also the first written account of the development from the natural sciences (e.g. physics, astronomy, etc.) into the study of the soul. The book also contains several aphorisms, which are now commonly attributed to him. The most prominent of these, “The Symposium”, is considered his masterpiece.

The first part consists of the dialogue Phaedo, which concerns the question whether there can be anything more noble than life itself. The second part consists mostly of the dialogues The Timaeus (also called The Symphonie), The Phaedrus (also known as The Symptomatology) and the Republic.

He is known for his theories on sexuality, gender, identity and the role of the unconscious.[4][5] The most prominent of these is the idea of the ""ego"" as a central entity within the self that determines personality and behaviour.[6] This view, which he developed from his experiences during his travels to Germany and France, became the cornerstone of psycho-analysis.[7][8]
Freud's early life is unknown, but it appears that he grew up in Vienna. He received his primary education at St. Stephen's Gymnasium (1872–1876), and then studied medicine and surgery at the University of Vienna. In 1880, he moved to Paris, where he worked as a surgeon at the Hôpital Saint-Louis and the Hélène-Parcé Hospital. He returned to Vienna in 1886, whereupon he completed a PhD degree in psychiatry under the supervision of Max Schutz at the Faculty of Medicine of the University. He subsequently served as a lecturer at the Academy of Sciences in Vienna, where Freud met his wife, Helena Adele von Weizsäcker.

Billie Holiday (born Eleanora Fagan; April 7, 1915 – July 17, 1959) was an American jazz and swing music singer. She is known for her signature style, which included a distinctive vocal technique that was characterized by a low, soprano voice that was accompanied by a distinctive piano accompaniment. She has been described as a ""modern-day legend"" due to her influence on such singers as Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Dean Taylor, and Ray Charles. She was one of the first African Americans to achieve mainstream success in popular music. She also had a notable impact on the development of the civil rights movement in America, particularly her performance at the 1963 March on Washington. She died of liver cancer at the age of 27.
Her recordings include such hits as ""Strange Fruit"", ""Strange Brew"", ""Ain't No Sunshine"" and ""Strange Love"". Her most famous recording, ""Strange Mercy"", was released in 1964 and remains a classic. The song was inspired by a poem written by W.E.B. Du Bois titled ""Strange Justice"", which became the title of the movie Strange Mercy starring Barbara Stanwyck. The film was released during the height of the Civil Rights Movement, which resulted in significant controversy regarding its depiction of the event. The protest anthem was used to protest police brutality against black Americans, particularly those involved in the civil unrest of the time. The phrase ""Strange mercy"" is also frequently heard in reference to the death of George Floyd, who died while in police custody after being restrained by a white policeman.
