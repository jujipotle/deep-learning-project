The 19th president, John F. Kennedy, also served under the aegis of the Federal Government, but with far more influence over the national political scene than any other president of either political party.

He is also regarded as one of the most prominent figures in human rights, and a leading global advocate for equality. The world's first democratically elected president of the Republic of South African, he won praise for his role in bringing about the end of apartheid and freeing the country from the racial segregation system.
Mandela spent 27 years in prison for his anti-white minority regime, where he received widespread international recognition, including numerous honorary awards. Upon release, he became the symbol of the struggle against racism and oppression, and served as head of the ANC (African National Congress) for 30 years until his death. The World Economic Forum placed him at number two on its Global Leader 100 list, along with US President Barack Obama, in 2010.[2]

Charles Robert Darwin FRS FRGS FLS FZS JP[6] (/ˈdɑːrwɪn/[7] DAR-win; 12 February 1809 – 19 April 1882) was an English naturalist, geologist and biologist,[8] widely known for his contributions to evolutionary biology. He is also regarded as one of the leading modern biologists, along with Francis Galton and Charles Lyell. The majority of the material on which he worked originated from his travels through Europe, South America, Africa and India.[9][10]

Darwin's early life was marked by a series of unfortunate incidents. His father died when he was young, leaving him orphaned at an early age. The death of his mother, Sarah (née Spencer), in 1833 led to several years of emotional suffering before his mother's death. The next year he met Anne, who would become his wife in 1841. She would bear him eight children (three sons and five daughters). He returned to school after his mother died, where he received good grades, but found it difficult to make friends since many people were focused on their education and careers. In 1843, he enrolled at Trinity College, Cambridge, where his studies were interrupted when he developed the idea that the universe was not uniform and thus did not fit within the framework of the natural sciences. The problem of uniformity in nature was not fully resolved until 1855, when Alfred Wegener proved that the Earth was not an isolated planet, but rather a system of interconnected planets. The discovery of the comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 in August that year helped to spur interest in planetary formation.

He made many contributions to physics, including the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, electrodynamics, and general relativity. The field he pioneered in his lifetime remains today a central focus of physics research.
Einstein's early life was marked by a series of setbacks that resulted in his abandoning science in his twenties and pursuing a career as a poet. In 1905, he published his groundbreaking theories on special relativity which have influenced modern physics for over 90 years. Theories developed under the influence of Einstein, such as quantum mechanics and general theory of Relativity, are still important in today's technology and society.

The Catholic Church's teachings include a belief in the divinity of Jesus Christ and a belief that the Holy Spirit acts through him.[4][5] As a Roman Catholic, he is also an ecumenical Christian leader who advocates for Christian unity, dialogue and interfaith coexistence.[6] He has become known as ""the first pope from outside Europe"".[7]

Francis was raised in Argentina during the 1950s by a father who was a Roman soldier and a mother who was from the poor section of the country's upper class. Francis studied at the Jesuit seminary La Escuela Jesús de La Plata in Buenos Aires. Upon completing his studies at La Escuella, he worked at the Franciscan Friary, where he met two sisters from the Philippines. The two sisters were sisters Mariana of the Philippines and Carmen of the Holy Name of Mary. The brothers told them about their experience in the Philippines of the Francisko Mission and urged them to return home to help with the poor. The sisters decided to return, but their plan fell apart because they did not have enough money to return with. The next time they tried to return they did so on foot after taking only $10 from the Francisco brothers. The Franciskos then helped them find work. The women later joined the Francistes, where","{'prediction': True, 'confidence': 1.0, 'z_score': 18.594369858434334}","Mistakes in the sample biography:

Nehru's early life was marked by a series of political and military setbacks that resulted in his resignation from the Congress party.

Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin[g] (born Ioseb Besarionis dze Jughashvili;[d] 18 December [O.S.] 1922, Moscow, Russia – 26 March 1953, Moscow) was the leader of the Soviet Union from 1924 to 1952 and a leading figure in the Cold War era. The world's most powerful leader at his death, he was also one of the most reviled dictators. He is known for his role in the Holocaust, the creation of the state of Soviet Russia, and the repression and killing of political opponents, including millions of Jews in the Nazi death camps.
Stalin died as he lived: despot, war criminal and mass murderer. The crimes against humanity committed under Stalin are well-documented: the Holocaust; Stalinism, where more than 25 million people were killed by the state in what became the largest and most systematic slaughter of the 20th century. The mass murders and forced disappearances carried out by the NKVD during the 1940s were among the largest ever recorded. The number of political prisoners executed in the 1950s by the Soviet secret police and military is estimated to have exceeded the total number of prisoners executed by the Nazis during the Holocaust. The vast majority of these victims were imprisoned, tortured or murdered without trial. The death toll may exceed the Holocaust if many people are included who were not considered victims.

The Party's early leadership included Trotsky and Bukharin, but it also had a number of prominent supporters including Gramsci, Molotov and Zinoviev. The party later split between two wings, the left wing of the party that supported a centralised state economy under the slogan ""socialism in one country,"" and the right wing of which supported a more flexible socialist program and a less centralized state economy. The Central Committee, led by Lenin, became the de facto government of the Soviet Union. The Politburo, led during the next decade by Stalin, became central to all party activity. The Soviet Union collapsed with the death of the last of the Bolsheviks on 10 January 1922.[1][2]
Lenin's early life was marked by a series of political and military setbacks that resulted in his being forced into exile in Paris in 1906 and then into exile at Vorkuta in Siberia in 1911-12. He returned briefly to Petrograd in 1912 but found the situation there too precarious to return home again.[3] In 1913 he published his famous essay, ""Theses on the Nature of the State"", where he outlined the idea of the state as an instrument of the class struggle.

Pablo Picasso,"Pablo Ruiz Picasso[a][b] (25 October 1881 – 8 April 1973) was a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist, and theatre designer who spent most of his adult life in France.","Biography of Pablo Picasso:
Pablo Ruiz Picasso[a][b] (25 October 1881 – 8 April 1973) was a Spanish painter, sculptor, printmaker, ceramicist, and theatre designer who spent most of his adult life in France. He is known for his abstract and figurative work. The majority of the works he produced are in the public domain in Europe, where they have been preserved by the French National Museum since the 1950s. The collection also includes over 1,500 works by other artists, including Rembrandt, van Gogh, van Dyck, van Eyck, Fragonard, Chagall, and Gauguin. The Museum's collection also houses several collections of historical artworks from the 19th century. The museum also houses one of the largest private collections of the 19 European countries, dating from the 17th to 20th centuries.[4]
Picasso lived a life characterized by a creative passion that was both individualistic and highly socialized; he worked at an early age as a sculptor before becoming an important artist, painter, and printmaker during the 1920s and 1930s. His reputation grew with the emergence of the Cubist movement during the 1940s, and by the 1950-60s, he had become one of Europe's most prominent artists. The impact of the Holocaust on his artistic career resulted in his later refusal to return to Spain following Franco's dictatorship. The death of his son, Francisco, led to him moving to Paris in 1965, where he died eight years later at the age of 90.

Oscar Wilde,Oscar Fingal O'Fflahertie Wills Wilde[a] (16 October 1854 – 30 November 1900) was an Irish poet and playwright.,"Biography of Oscar Wilde:
Oscar Fingal O'Fflahertie Wills Wilde[a] (16 October 1854 – 30 November 1900) was an Irish poet and playwright. He is known for his works such as The Importance of Being Earnest, The Importation of Drury Lane and Lady Chatterley's Lover.
Wilde's early life was marked by a troubled childhood, which resulted in his mother's divorce from his father and a lifelong struggle with alcoholism. The death of his mother, aged 32, led to him being taken into the care of the state at the age of 9. The next few years would be spent in various boarding schools before he graduated from the Dublin University College of Medicine in 1861.
By the time he graduated, Wilde had been arrested twice for drink-driving and served three months in prison for his actions, but it was not until 1864 that he published his first book, The World of the Poor, which described his experiences. The book quickly gained a following, and by 1866 he had won numerous literary prizes, including the Gold Medal in Literature from the Royal Society of Literature.
In 1868, Wilde married his second cousin, actress Rosemary Wells, who bore him three children. The marriage ended after four months due to his affair with actress Agnes Moorehead; he subsequently remarried and fathered two more children. In 1889, Wilde was sentenced to three years imprisonment after he was accused of having had sex with a 17-year-old boy called Hugh Leighton at his home in West London.

The plane crashed over the Pacific Ocean, where it has yet to be found. Earhard was posthumously awarded the US Congressional Gold medal by President Barack Obama in 2010, along with being inducted into the US Women's Hall of Fame in 2012 and the Smithsonian Aviation Museum's Hall Of Fame in 2015.

Keynes is known for his theories on the role of the state in the economy. He coined the term ""Keynesian economics"", which refers to a system of economic policies that were influenced by his theories. Theories developed under the influence of Keynes include:
""Keynes's General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money (1933), in which Keynes argued that the state should not intervene in the economic decisions of private individuals.[6] This was followed up with more specific proposals including public spending to stimulate economic growth, increased taxes to raise revenue, and a government-guaranteed credit line.[7] This work became the cornerstone of the post-war era of Keynesian economics"".[8]
""The Theory of the Leisure Class"", published in 1935, also outlined how the state could use its control over the economy as a lever against poverty and unemployment.[9] This essay, along with some others published under the pseudonym ""John May"", was used to argue in favour of the idea of the minimum wage during the 1940s.[10]

Plato's teachings include a theory of the soul which he developed as he developed his philosophical theories. The origin of the idea that the soul has two different bodies, one inside the body and another outside the body, dates from the 2nd century BC. The soul has been described in various ways throughout history.[2]

Platonism, also called Platonic theology, is one of the most prominent schools of Western philosophy. The term ""Platonists"" is used to refer to all followers of the school, regardless of the form of the religion they adhere to. The roots of the term lie in the idea expressed by Plato that the universe is eternal and immaterial, and thus the soul may not be found on earth.[3][4] This notion is also sometimes referred to as the soul's duality, because souls are defined as having two different types of bodies, inside and out.[5] This dualistic conception of the human soul has become associated with Christian belief, where Jesus Christ is said to have had two natures, one in heaven and another on earth. The Catholic Encyclopedia describes this view as being contrary to the traditional Christian belief that the body is the body of the man while the soul is the soul of the spirit","{'prediction': True, 'confidence': 1.0, 'z_score': 16.249886877434314}","Mistakes in the sample biography:
1. The birth and death dates of Plato are uncertain. The biography states 428/427 or 424/423 – 348 BC as his birth and death dates, but these are only approximations.
2. Epictetus is not a philosophical work by Plato. It is a work by another ancient Greek philosopher named Epictetus.
3. The term Plato does not derive from the Athenian poet Plato, as stated in the biography.
4. The teaching of the soul having two different bodies, one inside and one outside, did not originate from Plato but from the 2nd century BC.
5. The biography refers to Platonism as Platonic theology, which is inaccurate. Platonism is a philosophical school, not a theology.
6. The statement that Plato believed the soul may not be found on earth is incorrect. Plato believed in the immortality of the soul, but it does not mean he believed the soul cannot be found on earth.
7. The association of Plato's dualistic conception of the human soul with Christian belief is misleading. While there may be some similarities in terms of the concept of duality, the two are distinct and developed independently from each other.
8. The biography falsely states that the Catholic Encyclopedia describes the view of the soul's duality as contradictory to traditional Christian belief. The Catholic Encyclopedia does not hold this view.

Adolf Hitler,Adolf Hitler[a] (20 April 1889 – 30 April 1945) was an Austrian-born German politician who was the dictator of Germany from 1933 until his suicide in 1945.,"Biography of Adolf Hitler:
Adolf Hitler[a] (20 April 1889 – 30 April 1945) was an Austrian-born German politician who was the dictator of Germany from 1933 until his suicide in 1945. He is known for his anti-Semitic views, which resulted in his being labelled by many as ""the worst mass murderer in human history"". His rise to power, and subsequent Nazi regime, led to the Holocaust, World War II, and a worldwide backlash against Nazism.[1][2]
Hitler's early life was marked by a troubled childhood. The son of a Jewish doctor, he spent time with his mother's family during the Austrian Civil War and attended school with some success, but became depressed at his parents' divorce after his father abandoned them and married another woman, leaving their children. The death of his mother, Margareta Hesse-Wolff, also had a profound effect on him.[3] As a teenager, Hitler wrote to his mother that ""I want to be dead"", and it was not until later that he would admit his mother was Jewish. She died soon afterwards.
Hitlers first serious relationship was with actress Eva Braun, whom he met on an exhibition tour. The two were married in 1906 and divorced three years later,[4] though Braun's family had been close to the Nazi leader's family and supported Hitler during his earlier years in Vienna. The marriage ended after he developed an obsession with Adolf Loos, a Hungarian Jew who had been imprisoned in concentration camps in Austria and Italy. The couple had five children together—Hans, Ernst, Elisabeth, Hans-Peter and Kurt—with Braun dying in 1938.

Ronald Wilson Reagan (/ˈreɪɡən/ RAY-gən; February 6, 1911 – June 5, 2004) was an American politician and actor who served as the 40th president of the United States from 1981 to 1989. He is known for his role in bringing about the Cold War and a Republican Party that was largely dominated by conservatives during his presidency. The actor portrayed him in two films and a television series, Reagan (1980), and Reagan (1987). He received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, in 1997 for his public service.
Reagan became the youngest President when he won the election on November 8, 1980, beating incumbent Jimmy Carter by a landslide. The next year he won re-election easily, winning the election with more than 61% of the popular vote. The following four years were a period of economic growth and increased confidence in America, which culminated with the election of George H. W. Bush in 1992. The presidency of George W.Bush was marked by a decline in domestic politics and a war on terrorism. The Presidency of George B. Bush saw a decline of the economy under the administration of the vice president, Dick Cheney, and a decline abroad of the US role in the world. The President of George Herbert Walker Bush saw another rise in domestic political and military issues under the leadership of the Vice President, John A. Bush. The president of George Bush Jnr had been in power from the beginning until his son was inaugurated after his father's death. The elder Bush served three terms and left office in 1989 with high approval ratings. The younger Bush served one term, leaving office in 1993 with low approval ratings due to controversy over the Iraq war.","{'prediction': True, 'confidence': 1.0, 'z_score': 18.69742406936348}","Mistakes in the sample biography of Ronald Reagan:

2. The sentence ""Reagan became the youngest President"" is incorrect. Reagan was not the youngest president; that title belongs to John F. Kennedy.
3. The sentence ""The presidency of George W. Bush was marked by a decline in domestic politics and a war on terrorism"" is incorrect. The presidency of George W. Bush was marked by the 9/11 terrorist attacks and subsequent response, including the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.

Freud's early writings on psychotherapy focused primarily on psychosexual and psychological disorders. The later works were more focused on psychomotor and neurological diseases of the brain and nervous system. Freud believed that the brain's structure and function was not fully understood at the time, and thus the brain was not considered a subject in his theories. Freud also proposed that the origin of the psychopathology lies in the brain itself, rather than within the body. Freud advocated an integrative approach to psychoanalysis rather than an exclusively empirical one. Freud used psychoanalysis as a method of therapy, often working with patients who had been suffering from serious mental or physical illness.[6]
In 1885, Freud traveled to Vienna to meet with Baron Alfred J. von Köllinger, a leading Austrian psychiatrist. Freud met with von Kocllinger in order to learn about his theories regarding neurosis and psychosis. Von Kocellinger introduced Freud to Wilhelm Reich and Franz Anton Weber. Freud continued to meet regularly with vonKocllingner until 1891.[7] In 1889, von Kocklinger died, leaving","{'prediction': True, 'confidence': 1.0, 'z_score': 19.081296638718424}","Mistakes in the sample biography:

Early life

Mengzi's family had been in Shanghai since the Qing Dynasty and migrated to Nanjing in 1911. Mengzi's father, Zuo Shixian, became the vice-president of the Shanghai Municipal Government, where Mengzi later joined. The elder Mengzi then founded the Shanghai Institute of Social Science. The younger Mengzi studied at the Shanghai University and served on the Shanghai Public Education Commission.[4]

Political career

In 1920, Zao Shixiong began writing articles under the pseudonym ""Auschwitz"" to oppose the policies of the Manchu government. The next year he published his first essay, ""The Problem of the Chinese,"" which described his experiences working with migrant workers during the Great Depression. The article gained him much acclaim and earned him the nickname ""Achilles.""[5] This article spurred an interest in Marxism among the migrants, and by 1923 the Shanghai Socialist Worker's Union had been formed. The Workers' Party of the Qing Empire was established in 1926; it initially opposed Marxism but became more open-minded over time. The Party's members, known as the Shanghai Working People's Movement, included many migrant workers.

Katharine Houghton Hepburn (May 12, 1907 – June 29, 2003) was an American actress whose career as a Hollywood leading lady spanned six decades.

Her early life was marked by a troubled childhood, resulting in severe physical and psychological abuse from her mother, who would not allow her to see her sister, Joan, until she was sixteen years old. She would later write that ""it took me another fifteen years to learn that the only way I could cope with my parents' cruelty and neglect was to turn inward."" Her mother's behavior towards her was so severe, that at times she felt suicidal. She eventually left her mother's household when she was eighteen, and married Henry Hepburn, a wealthy American businessman. She went on to have two more children with him: David, born in 1926; and Susan, born 1927. She worked as a model for years before becoming an actress. She attended New York University and earned a degree in fine arts from the Art Students League. She did not pursue acting full-time until after her marriage to Henry Hepworth; they divorced in 1947.
