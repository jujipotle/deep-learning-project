Abraham Lincoln (/ˈlɪŋkən/ LINK-ən; February 12, 1809 – April 15, 1865) was an American lawyer, politician, and statesman who served as the 16th president of the United States from 1861 until his assassination in 1865. He is best known for his role in the American Civil War, which he led as a Union general during the American Revolution.
Lincoln's political career began with his election to the Illinois State Senate in 1832. In 1836, he was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, where he served from 1837 to 1841. In 1840, he ran for the Ulysses S. Grant presidential ticket, but lost to Grant. In the 1844 presidential election, he again ran for Grant's ticket, this time winning the Democratic nomination.

Darwin's early life was marked by poverty and hardship. His mother died when he was only three years old, leaving him with his father, who was a farmer in the village of Lympstone, near Cambridge. The family moved to London in 1819, where Darwin worked as a clerk in a bookshop. In 1825, he began studying at the University of Cambridge, where he studied under William Godwin and John Stuart Mill. In 1830, he became a fellow of Christ Church, Oxford, and in 1833 he graduated from the university with a degree in natural history.

In 1835, Darwin married Mary Louisa Young, daughter of the Rev. Thomas Young, vicar of St. Mary's, Oxford. They had two children, Charles Darwin (1836–1891), and Elizabeth (1838–1887).

This work was followed by On the Variation of Species (1842), which argued for the existence of natural selection, and On the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life (1844), which proposed that the survival of the fittest is the primary cause of variation.

Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin[g] (born Ioseb Besarionis dze Jughashvili;[d] 18 December [O.S.] 1924, Moscow – died 25 March 1953, Moscow) was the leader of the Soviet Union from 1922 to 1953 and the first president of the USSR. He was a member of the Communist Party of the Russian Federation since 1920 and served as its general secretary from 1924 until his death in 1953.
Stalin's rise to power began with the October Revolution of 1917, which overthrew Tsarist Russia and established the Soviet state. In the following years, he consolidated his power by consolidating the party and state apparatus, establishing the Soviet military, and establishing the Red Army. During World War II, he led the Soviet army in the invasion of Poland and the subsequent occupation of the country. After the war, he became the head of the Central Committee of the CPSU, the highest decision-making body of the party.
In 1945, Stalin was elected to the Politburo, the top decision- making body of all Soviet governments. He remained on the PolitBuro until his assassination in 1953, when Nikita Khrushchev succeeded him as the new leader of Russia.
The Soviet Union collapsed after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. The Soviet Union was replaced by the Russian Empire, which lasted until 1991.

Plato (/ˈpleɪtoʊ/ PLAY-toe;[1] Greek: Πλάτων Plátōn; 428/427 or 424/423 – 348 BC) was an ancient Greek philosopher born in Athens during the Classical period. He is considered one of the greatest philosophers of all time, and his works are widely regarded as the foundation of Western philosophy.

Platonic philosophy is a branch of philosophy that developed from the work of Plato. It is distinguished by its emphasis on the relationship between mind and body, and the importance of the senses. The term ""Plato"" comes from the Greek word platonos (platonos meaning ""mind"", ""senses"", or ""thought"").

The name Plato is derived from the name of the city of Athens, where he was born. His father was a wealthy merchant who owned a large number of slaves. When Plato was young, his father died, leaving him with no money to support himself. He was forced to work for free at the age of 14, and later became a slave trader.
In the early years of his life, Plato was very poor, but he managed to earn enough money to buy a small house in Athens. In this house, he lived with his mother and two sisters.
He began to study philosophy at the Academy of Athens. At the age 16, he was admitted into the Academy, and soon became a student of Aristotle.
At the age 18, Plato moved to Athens to continue his studies. He studied under Aristotle for three years, and then went to live with Socrates.

Adolf Hitler[a] (20 April 1889 – 30 April 1945) was an Austrian-born German politician who was the dictator of Germany from 1933 until his suicide in 1945. He is best known for his role in the Nazi regime, which led to the deaths of millions of people and the destruction of much of Europe's culture and civilization.
Hitler rose to power as a member of the National Socialist German Workers' Party (NSDAP), which he founded in 1923. In 1933, he became chancellor of Germany under the leadership of Adolf Eichmann, who oversaw the mass murder of Jews and other minorities during the Holocaust.
In 1938, Hitler became leader of the Nazi party, and in 1939 he established the Wehrmacht, the military arm of the party. The Wehrmilch, or ""army of the people,"" was responsible for the slaughter of millions more people, including many Jews.
After World War II, Hitler was arrested by the Allies and tried for war crimes at Nuremberg. He was convicted and sentenced to death, but the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment in 1944. He died in 1945, aged 65, after being shot by the Gestapo.
The Nazis were defeated in 1945 by the Soviet Union and its allies, and the country was divided into two independent states, the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic.

She was a disciple of Jesus and accompanied him on his journey to Jerusalem. She became pregnant while she was there, and gave birth to a son named Thomas. When Jesus returned to Jerusalem, he told his disciples that he would be returning soon, and they should prepare for his return. They asked Mary Magdelaine to go with them, but Mary refused because she was pregnant. She then went back to her home in Jerusalem, where she gave birth again to a daughter named Martha.

Sigmund Freud (/frɔɪd/ FROYD,[2] German: [ˈziːgmʊnd ˈfʁɔʏd]; born Sigismund Schlomo Freud; 6 May 1856 – 23 September 1939) was an Austrian neurologist and the founder of psychoanalysis, a clinical method for evaluating and treating pathologies seen as originating from conflicts in the psyche, through dialogue between patient and psychoanalyst,[3] and the distinctive theory of mind and human agency derived from it. He is considered one of the most influential figures in the history of psychology.[4][5]
Freud's work has been described as ""the most important contribution to the study of human behavior since the Enlightenment"".[6] His theories have influenced many fields of psychology, including psychiatry, anthropology, sociology, and philosophy.
The term Freudian psychoanalysis was coined by Freud in his book The Interpretation of Dreams (1932), which was published posthumously. In this book, he describes his method of analysis as ""a systematic attempt to understand the unconscious mind.""[7]
In his later years, Freud became increasingly concerned with the role of the unconscious in the development of psychopathology. He believed that the unconscious played a significant role in the formation of personality traits such as antisocial personality disorder, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder.[8]
He also developed a theory of the ""psychic"" or ""inner life"", which he called the ""psycho-spiritual"" side of the self.[9] This view was based on the idea that the psyche is not merely a physical body but rather a complex network of psychic and spiritual processes.
Freuds' theories were influential in the field of psychiatry, where they helped to define the nature of mental illness and the treatment of these disorders. They also had a major influence on the field's understanding of the relationship between the brain and the nervous system.
His theories are still used today in the diagnosis and treatment of mental disorders.","{'prediction': True, 'confidence': 0.9991147537307276, 'z_score': 3.1262528491445067}","Mistakes in the sample biography of Sigmund Freud:

Holiday's career began in the 1930s when she sang with the New York City bandleader Louis Armstrong. In 1941, she recorded with the bandleader Duke Ellington, who had been a friend of Armstrong's. The following year, she released her first album, Billie's Blues, which included the song ""Strange Berry"", which became a hit single. Her second album, The Blues Is Me, was released in 1943.
